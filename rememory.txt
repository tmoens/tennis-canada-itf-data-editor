Configuration:

For differences between development and production configuration, look in /environments.
This is critical for everything to do with Okta - the configuration in the
environment files parallels the configuration of the application on Okta.

For development:

ng serve --environment=dev

Build for production

ng build --base-href=/TCExternalData/ --environment=prod

Build in production mode for local test

ng build --base-href=/TCExternalData/ --environment=localProd
